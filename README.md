# 🐚 MyShell - A Simple Unix Shell Clone in C

Welcome to **MyShell** – a lightweight and minimalist Unix Shell written in C! 🧠💻  
It mimics the basic functionality of a real shell like `bash` or `zsh`, allowing you to execute commands, navigate directories, and more. Ideal for learning how shells work under the hood.

---

## 🚀 Features

✅ Run external commands (like `ls`, `pwd`, `gcc`, etc.)  
✅ Built-in `cd` command to change directories  
✅ Built-in `exit` command to quit the shell  
✅ Fork-exec mechanism for running programs  
✅ Simple command parsing with arguments

## 🛠️ How to Compile & Run

🔧 Compile the shell:
gcc myshell.c -o myshell


▶️ Run the shell:

## 🧪 Example Commands
<br>mysh> ls<br>
<br>mysh> cd .. <br>
<br>mysh> pwd<br>
<br>mysh> echo Hello Shell!<br>
<br>mysh> exit<br>

## 📌 Notes

This shell currently supports:
- External command execution
- Built-in `cd`
- Built-in `exit`

Coming soon:
- Pipes (`|`)
- Redirection (`>`, `<`)
- Background processes (`&`)

---

## 💡 Learning Objectives

By building this shell, you will:
- Understand how process creation works using `fork()` and `execvp()`
- Learn to parse and tokenize input strings
- Grasp basic Unix system programming concepts
